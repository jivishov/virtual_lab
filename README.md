# Virtual Laboratory

**Interactive Scientific Experiments and Simulations for Hands-On Learning**

Visit: [virtuallab.az](https://virtuallab.az)

## About the Project

Virtual Laboratory is an open-source educational platform that makes quality science education accessible to students worldwide. The project leverages modern web technologies to create interactive science simulations and virtual lab experiments that can be accessed from any device with a web browser.

## Our Vision

Virtual experiments serve as pre-lab activities, similar to how flight simulators prepare pilots before actual flights. Each simulation guides users through every procedural step required in real laboratory settings, building confidence and understanding before hands-on work.

By providing virtual access to laboratory experiences, this project reaches communities where well-equipped lab facilities may not be available, ensuring all students can experience the complete experimental process.

## Available Experiments

### Virtual Experiments
1. **Spectrophotometry: Blue Dye Analysis**
   Determine the concentration of blue dye in a sports drink using spectrophotometry techniques. Learn about Beer's Law and calibration curves.

2. **DNA Microarray**
   Explore gene expression analysis using DNA microarray technology. Understand how genetic information is analyzed and interpreted.

3. **Copper in Brass Analysis**
   Determine the amount of copper in a brass sample using spectrophotometric methods. Apply quantitative analysis techniques.

### Simulations
1. **Nuclear Chemistry Game**
   Interactive simulation exploring nuclear reactions, radioactive decay, and nuclear chemistry principles through engaging gameplay.

2. **Mission: Impossible - Lab Safety Protocol**
   Navigate through 10 high-stakes laboratory scenarios. Master critical safety protocols in this immersive spy-themed training simulation with realistic animations.

3. **Gas Laws Simulation**
   Explore the fundamental gas laws through interactive simulations. Investigate relationships between pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas in real-time experiments.

## Multilingual Support

The Virtual Laboratory interface is available in multiple languages to ensure accessibility for students worldwide:
- **English**
- **Azərbaycan dili** (Azerbaijani)
- **Türkçe** (Turkish)
- **Deutsch** (German)

Language barriers should never prevent students from accessing quality science education.

## Educational Use

These virtual experiments are actively used in real classroom environments. The platform serves as:
- **Pre-lab preparation** for hands-on experiments
- **Supplementary learning** for remote students
- **Practice environments** for mastering laboratory techniques
- **Accessible alternatives** where physical labs are not available

## Open Source Commitment

Virtual Laboratory is released under the MIT License, making it freely available for educational use, modification, and distribution. All code is open source, encouraging contributions from educators, developers, and students worldwide.
